Study Case: Reinforcement Learning on Artificial Bacterial Flagella (ABF) in 2D
=================================================================================

A 2D version of artificial bacterial flagella (ABF) subjected to a rotating magnetic field.
The goal is to bring those swimmers within a target circle by controlling a uniform magnetic field.
